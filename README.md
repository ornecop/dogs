<h1 align="center">Dogs Project</h1>

<p align="center">
During my participation in the Henry bootcamp, I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project centered around the theme of "Dogs." This project involved the development of both the backend and the frontend of an application that interacted with a specialized API focused on dogs. The project aimed to provide users with an engaging platform to explore various aspects of dogs and their information.

## Features

### 1. Dog Filter List

The main focus of the project was to create an intuitive way for users to search for dogs based on specific characteristics. To achieve this, I implemented a dynamic filter list on the website's main page. This feature allows users to easily narrow down their search based on criteria such as breed, size, color, and more. By providing this filtering mechanism, users can quickly find the dogs that match their preferences.

### 2. Pagination for Enhanced User Experience

To enhance the overall user experience and prevent overwhelming them with an endless list of dogs, I designed a pagination feature. This feature ensures that only 9 dogs are displayed per page. This approach not only makes the navigation smoother but also allows users to focus on a manageable number of dogs at a time, making their exploration of the platform more enjoyable.

### 3. Adding New Dogs

I dedicated special attention to the process of adding new dogs to the platform. I created a dedicated section that enables users with appropriate permissions to easily add information about new dogs. This feature ensures that the platform remains up-to-date with the latest information on various dog breeds, contributing to its usefulness and credibility.

### 4. Detailed Dog Information

Understanding that users might want in-depth information about specific dogs, I crafted a detailed dog information segment. This section provides users with comprehensive details about each canine, including its breed history, temperament, characteristics, and more. By offering this level of detail, the platform aims to be a valuable resource for dog enthusiasts seeking accurate and comprehensive information.
